Testing testing, you can hear me, right?
Ok, good. It looks like you can receive transmissions.
So, how does it feel to be sailing through the sky for the first time?
This session will mostly be an explanation of the various aerial gadgets pilots like us have at our disposal.
But before I  get into the nitty-gritty, I'll to patch you through to our ground team.
...
Hey there, rookie! I'm going to be one of the only 2 voices you'll hear while up in that metal death machine.
I  know, really puts things into perspective, doesn't it?
I  might be part of the ground team right now, but I'm actually the head of the Research and Development unit.
Yeah, you should see some of the crazy inventions he comes up with. 
Well, speak of the devil, here comes one now. 
Yup, that's my patented support drone (trademark). Whenever you have enough energy, feel free to call one.
Just make sure it doesn't get destroyed, these are meant to be disposable, after all.
Usually they'll deliver supplies essential for repairing your ship, but I've loaded this one up with something special.
Go ahead, fly over it to pick it up.

As you can see, that's a basic aerial cannon (also trademarked). It's simple, but reliable.
I  mean, I  haven't been in a fighter so I  wouldn't know, but that's what these instructions say, so who am I  to question it?
In any case, I think I'll take him over to the shooting gallery to get some practice in.
Good idea, I'll monitor the radar and let you know if something comes up... Or down.
Have fun, don't let the weather *cloud* your judgement. 
Sorry, always wanted to use that one. See ya!
Well, that's the head of R&D for you. He's a bit eccentric, but trust me, he's quite personable once you get to know him.
...
Training squadron 3, this is the Commander. what is your position?
Huh? Why's the Commander transmitting to us?
I  repeat, what is your position? Have you headed to the shooting range?
Both of you need to land at the nearest docking bay ASAP. This is an emergency. 
I've picked something up on the radar, it's coming your way fast. 
Wait, it's here, brace yourselves!
